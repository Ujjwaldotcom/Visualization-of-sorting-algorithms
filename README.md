# Visualization-of-sorting-algorithms
"The greatest value of a picture is when it forces us to notice what we never expected to see."
                                                                              - John W. Tukey
                                                                                             
I have made this project for the beginners who have started their journey in Python or in programming as a whole, to easily make them understand the sorting algorithms through visualization. Visualization of Bubble, Selection, Insertion, Merge, Quick and Heap Sorting techniques is done using Matplotlib library of Python.
